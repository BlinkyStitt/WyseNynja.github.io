title: "Playing with the Steam Web API"
---

Every time I sit down to play games on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) with my friends, we spend far too long figuring out what games everyone has before we actually decide what to play.

Being a software engineer, [I did what I always do](http://steam.stitthappens.com/).

I built a very simple [flask]() app (only 120 lines of python code and 88 lines of jinja templates) that uses [steamodd](https://github.com/Lagg/steamodd) to show the games that steam users have in common.

[The Steam Web API docs](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API) don't seem to have all the things I expected, but they got me this far.

Things I still want to add:

* Cost of the games
* Links to buy the games that not everyone has
* Show gift copies of games
* Better definition of display name vs steamid vs steamid64.
* Online/offline icons for all the players
* Have a button to auth with steam so we can fetch their userid without them looking it up
* Show friends lists for all the queried users with check boxes to add the friends without having to type any names or look up any 64-bit ids
* Only include actually installed games. I'm not sure this is possible
* Filesize of the games
* Caching
* Rate-limiting
* Better CSS than [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)

Have ideas for other improvements? Send me an IM or an email.
